How to build Alder
====================

Alder uses CMake (http://cmake.org/) to configure its build process.  CMake is operating system
independent, so in theory it should be possible to build this project under Linux, Windows or
Macintosh.  I strees the words "in theory" since it has currently only been tested and developed
under Linux.


Required Libraries
==================

Alder uses the VTK library for visualization purposes and the Qt library for its user interface
Furthermore it, along with VTK, is built using CMake.  Other 


libxml2 (xmlsoft.org)
---------------------
You will need to install libxml2.  This can be done by downloading pre-compiled binaries or
building from the source, both of which are available from the website.  Many linux package
managers also include this library in their repositories.


Qt4 (qt.nokia.com)
------------------
You will need the Qt4 development/framework libraries.  You can download these from the Qt
website or install them using your distro's package manager.  The complete SDK isn't necessary.


Crypto++ (www.cryptopp.com)
---------------------------
You will need the Crypto++ development libraries.  You can download these from the cryptopp.com
website or install them using your distro's package manager.


JSON CPP (jsoncpp.sourceforge.net)
----------------------------------
You will need the jsoncpp development libraries.  You can download these from the sourceforge
website or install them using your distro's package manager.


MySQL (www.mysql.com)
---------------------
You will need to install mysql library files and configure your VTK build to use them (see
below).

CURL (curl.haxx.se/libcurl/)
---------------------
You will need to install curl library files and configure your VTK build to use them (see
below).

ImageMagick (www.imagemagick.org)
--------------------
ImageMagick must be installed.


CMake (cmake.org)
-----------------
There are plenty of pre-compiled binaries of CMake available on the website, or you can download
the source and build it yourself.  Also, many linux distros have it build into their package
managers.  I recommend trying this option first since it's the quickest and easiest to do.


VTK (vtk.org)
-------------
You will need the build VTK from the source code which can be downloaded from their website.
VTK uses CMake to set up the build environment the same way that Alder does:

1. Download the source code version 5.10.0 or later and unpack the source code

2. Create a build directory somewhere OUTSIDE of the VTK source code tree.  It's important to
   do this somewhere other than the source tree so that if things go wrong you can just nuke
   the build directory and start over without loosing any source files.

3. Inside your build directory, run cmake:

   For linux: cmake -g "Unix Makefiles" /path/to/VTK/source
   
   (If you want to build under a different operating system then just type cmake (without any
   arguments) to see a list of options along with (at the bottom) a list of "generators" which
   you can use in place of "Unix Makefiles" above.  Under windows it would be "Visual Studio" or
   "NMake" under windows, or "XCode" under Mac.

   If all goes well you should see cmake spit out a bunch of text but no errors.

4. You should now have a CMakeCache.txt file (along with a bunch of other stuff).  Open it
   with your favourite editor and set the following:

   BUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=ON
   CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release
   VTK_USE_QT:BOOL=ON
   VTK_USE_MYSQL:BOOL=ON

5. Re-run cmake by typing "cmake ." in the build directory.  When it is done you should a message
   something like "Build files have been written to: ..."

6. You are now ready to build the VTK libraries by typing "make".  This should take anywhere from
   a few minutes to an hour or more, depending on the system.


GDCM (http://sourceforge.net/projects/gdcm/)
--------------------------------------------
You will need to build GDCM from the source code which can be downloaded from their website.
VTK also uses CMake to set up the build environment.  The following option must be set in the
CMakeCache.txt file:

  GDCM_USE_VTK:BOOL=ON

Make sure that the GDCM_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS parameter in GDCM's CMakeLists.txt file matches the
BUILD_SHARED_LIBS parameter in VTK's CMakeLists.txt file, otherwise you may get linker errors
when building Alder.


Building Alder
==============

Once you've gone through the process of building VTK using CMake this will seem familiar.

1. Get a copy of Alder.

2. Create a build directory somewhere OUTSIDE of the Alder source code tree (again, outside
   for the same reasons as I described in building VTK above).

3. Inside your build directory, run cmake:

   For linux: cmake -g "Unix Makefiles" /path/to/Alder/source

   Unlike when preparing VTK, this time you should see cmake spit out some errors.  That's
   fine, this is because cmake needs to know where you put VTK (and the other libraries if they
   were not installed in a standard place)

4. Ignore the errors for now and open the CMakeCache.txt file and change the following:

   CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release
   VTK_DIR:PATH=/path/to/VTK/build/directory/

5. Re-run cmake by typing "cmake ." in the build directory.  When it is done the error message
   should go away and you see "Build files have been written to: ..." once more.

6. Make sure to set the salt string to something (anything) other than the default text.

   ALDER_SALT_STRING:STRING=put anything here

7. You are now ready to build Alder by typing "make".


Preparing Database
==================

(TODO: this process needs to be scripted by CMake)

After building Alder you are now ready to prepare the database.

1. Create database named Alder and grant all priviledges to a user

   EG: create database Alder; grant all on Alder.* to someuser@localhost identified by "somepassword"

2. Go to the sql directory and run the schema.sql script into the Alder database

   EG: cat schema.sql Modality.sql | mysql Alder -u someuser -p

3. The build procedure (see "Building Alder") will create a config.xml file in the root of the
   build directory.  Edit the file to include the database and Opal configuration as well as the
   path you wish image data to reside in.


Building documentation
======================

1. Install the following packages: doxygen gnuplot graphviz

2. Edit the CMakeCache.txt file, setting BUILD_DOCUMENTATION to ON

3. Re-run cmake in the root of the build directory, this will create a new directory named
   doxygen.

4. In the doxygen directory run cmake -P doc_makeall.cmake
